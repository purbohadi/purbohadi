> Fix a bug is like solving a puzzle, start by understanding the root cause and build a structure of possible solution around it.

In workplace a bug is raised by user or tester usually, while more advance tools like selenium provide an automated testing for generating issues.

In software production bugs production is inevitable, thus it's part of the technical debt need to be addressed by developers.

A bug is a result of working a software which has not been tested under specific circumstances or scenario.

Developers use most of their time to analyze the root cause of the issue and try to code the workaround for the issue.

A working software may hide some bugs inside it, hence problems may happen under specific condition which may unintentionally triggered by user.

Should we take it for granted or think bug as a feature?
